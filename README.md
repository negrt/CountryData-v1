# CountryDataSearch
A C# desktop application that reads JSON files and then displays data on a graphical user interface. This application uses a Country Dynamic Link Library that contains country objects I created to help store country data. The country Dynamic Link Library is in a seperate respository. I created this application in Visual Studios 2017 using C# and XAML.

# What I learned
* How to store C# objects on a list using C# generics
* How to create XAML graphical user interfaces
* How to deserialize JSON files
* How to bind user interface and business logic

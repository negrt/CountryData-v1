# CountryDataSearchTool-v1
A C# desktop application that read a country data JSON file and then displays a target country data on a graphical user interface. This application uses a Country Dynamic Link Library to help store country data to the CPUs RAM. The country Dynamic Link Library is in a seperate respository. I created this application in Visual Studios 2017 using C# and XAML.

# What I learned
* How to store C# objects on a list using C# generics
* How to create XAML graphical user interfaces
* How to deserialize JSON files
* How to bind user interface and business logic
* How to use a open file dialog object

# Notice
This application uses a separate Dynamic Link Library. See CountryDynamicLinkLibrary repository to run this application appropriately.
